  My computer science experience started in my freshman year when I started using Scratch for one of the classes offered on campus that is supposed to be a teaser for the field of computer science. The most important thing I remembered from that class was how interesting programs seemed to work, however rudimentary it might’ve seemed. I couldn’t really see myself studying any other field; however, I do have a passion for the arts, visual and musical, but I just couldn’t see myself making a sustainable career for myself and a future family. As of now, I’m familiar with Java, Python, as well as HTML/CSS for web design. I’ve created miniature, simple projects and games like Treasure Hunt, Tic Tac Toe, and have experimented with the different elements used in CSS to gain experience in the various languages. 

  In this course, I would like to see the status of web development and how to adapt to the rapidly changing field that I find myself interested in. Additionally, I would like to create projects and get more hands-on with my learning instead of learning the theoretical and academic, which is something I’ve learned sufficiently enough. When I was sent the first email outlining everything we learned in this course, I was undoubtedly intimidated, but soon realized the value of this class and what it can give me if I apply myself and do the work.
